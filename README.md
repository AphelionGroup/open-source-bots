# Open source bots

This repo is a collection of open source bots for Twitter, Slack, IRC and other networks. It is suplementary to [botwiki.org/tag/opensource](https://botwiki.org/tag/opensource):

- Botwiki.org doesn't allow browsing multiple tags at once (yet), so you can't easily see only opensourced Twitter bots
- Botwiki.org doesn't aim to list all online bots, but there should be a list of all open source bots
