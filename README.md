# Open source bots

After several improvements to [Botwiki](https://botwiki.org/), the content of this repository was moved back to the original site. The search has been improved and you can also easily browse bots by categories, for example:

- [All open source bots](https://botwiki.org/bot/?opensource=true)
- [Open source Twitter bots](https://botwiki.org/bot/?networks=twitter-bots&opensource=true)
- [Open source Slack bots](https://botwiki.org/bot/?networks=slack-bots&opensource=true)
- [Open source Internet of Things (IoT) bots](https://botwiki.org/bot/?tags=iot&opensource=true)
- [Open source game bots](https://botwiki.org/bot/?tags=game&opensource=true)
